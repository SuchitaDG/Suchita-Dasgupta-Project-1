Analysis Outcome:
After previewing and analyzing "Dealers_working_during_losses" file, it is clear dealer "Billy Jones" was working at the Roulette game on all 13 times when the losses occured.

It was easy to complete this analysis this time since only dealer was involved when the losses occurred. However, I wrote an awk script "count_dealer.awk" to analyze "Dealers_working_druing_losses" file for future scenarios.

Command I used to run awk script is as follows:
$awk -f count_dealer.awk Lucky_Duck_Investigations/Roulette_Loss_Investigation/Dealer_Analysis/Dealers_working_during_losses
